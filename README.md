## ‚ú® Key Features

### üóìÔ∏è 1. Automated Jam Polling and Alerts

The bot handles a weekly cycle of automated polls and follow-up alerts to ensure space access and jam coordination:

#### Weekly Jam Attendance Polls
Every **Monday at 12 PM**, the bot posts a poll in each jam session channel (`rock`, `jazz`, `pop`) asking members if they are attending and what instrument they plan to bring.

#### Weekly Card Holder Availability Poll
Simultaneously, a poll is posted in the `card-holders` channel to determine which card holders are available to unlock the space on:
- **Saturday at 12 PM**
- **Sunday at 12 PM**

#### Thursday Availability Alert
On **Thursday at 6 PM**, if **no card holders** have marked availability for either day, the bot sends an alert in the `card-holders` channel to prompt a response.

#### Friday Jam Session Warnings
On **Friday at 8 PM**, if any jam session does **not have a card holder available**, a message is sent to the relevant jam channels to notify members that the space may not be open.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è 2. Jam Commands

The `!jam_info` command sends a detailed message explaining how jam sessions work, with helpful links to:
- The Creative Space location
- The shared Jam Songs spreadsheet

The `!jam_songs <sheet_name> <song_amount>` command lists the top 10 songs from the specified sheet (`Jazz`, `Rock`, `Pop`), sorted by its **Vote Rank** on Youtube.  
- Pulls live song data from the shared Jam Songs spreadsheet, whose songs are first added to a youtube playlist.  
- Displays song titles, vote counts, and status in a clean embedded format  
- Helps members see the most popular songs for upcoming sessions
